# DIGM 350 Final: Icarus
## What is this?
For Drexel’s Digital Storytelling (DIGM 350) class, students are tasked with making an interactive take on a famous tale. This is the repository for one of those projects, a playable game based on the tale of Icarus, developed by:
- Joshua Walcott (programmer)
- Zac Milman (artist)
- Carmen-Mai Riley (artist)
- Harry (artist)
## Project Structure (for team members)
Putting this here so that assets get put in the right locations. Incorrectly placed assets will be moved to their appropriate locations.
This will change as the project evolves & more assets are created.
### Assets
#### Audio
*Anything to do we sound (if we have any sound).*
#### Graphics
*This is where most stuff by artists should be put.*
##### Materials
*Unity Materials*
##### Shaders
*Shader graphs & HLSL scripts.*
##### Sprites
*Any 2D stuff; graphics such as characters, backgrounds, etc. Feel free to make subfolders for further organization.*
#### Prefabs
*Reusable GameObjects. In general, stuff shouldn't be put here unless it has colliders or scripts. If it's otherwise static, then it should go somewhere in Graphics.*
#### Scenes
*Playable Unity scenes.*
#### Scripts
*C# scripts.*
#### Settings
*You shouldn’t need to mess with this, unless you’re doing some shader shenanigans.*
### Packages
*In most circumstances, assets should not be placed here manually.*

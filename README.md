## Project Structure (for team members)
Putting this here so that assets get put in the right locations. If this is not followed, your stuff will be moved.
### Assets
#### Audio
#### Graphics
*This is where most stuff by artists should be put.*
##### Materials
*Unity Materials*
##### Sprites
*Any 2D stuff.*
#### Prefabs
*Reusable GameObjects. In general, stuff shouldn't be put here unless it has colliders or scripts. If it's static, then it should go somewhere in Graphics.*
#### Scenes
*Playable Unity scenes.*
#### Scripts
*C# scripts*
#### Settings
*You shouldn’t need to mess with this, unless you’re doing some shader shenanigans.*
### Packages
*In most circumstances, assets should not be placed here manually.*
